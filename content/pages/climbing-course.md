Title: Climbing Course

# Part 1

## The harness

#### Putting a harness on:

* there shouldn't be any twists and turns
* equipment hooks should point downwards
* metallic hooks should point to the outside
* should not slide up/down the hip bone

## Using figure-8 knots to tie-in

#### Figure-8 knot tie-in:

* loop should be as big or smaller than the belay hoop
* should pass through both upper and lower harness hoops
* slack should be less than 10cm
* measure rope length from left shoulder to right arm length
* make a snowman, give him a scarf, poke him in the eye
* with inner loop pointing to the right, follow the knot after passing the slack
through the upper and lower harness hoops: OUTSIDE, OUTSIDE, INSIDE

## Belaying

#### The device:

* climber end should point upwards
* hand end should point downwards
* make a rope loop, pass it through, then pass carbine through both rope loop and
the belay device hoop
* there should be a knot near the end of the rope

#### The technique:

* *always* use full hand grips (4 fingers + thumb around)
* thumbs always point towards the belay
* right hand grips below the belay
* left hand pinches rope above the belay, detects slack and gently pulls it down
* move right hand below the device as fast as possible
* grip with (full) left hand above the right hand
* bring right hand to about 10cm below the belay
* move left hand back to pinch position

## Body checks

#### Climber body check:

* compare the knot loop length to the belay loop length
* check that the figure 8 is correctly tied (5 times 2 on up/down sides. 4 parallel
lines on left/right sides)
* check that the slack is not longer than 10cm

#### Belayer check:

* check that the belay device is correctly positioned and configured
* tap the carbine to make sure it's correctly closed

#### Both climber + belayer body check:

* check the harness -> equipment + metallic hooks positioning
* check the harness -> should not slide up/down the hip bone

#### Rope checks:

* check that the rope is the same
* check that there are no twists and turns
* check that there's an extra knot near the end of the rope

## Signaling

#### Before each climb:

* belayer shouts _"on belay!"_
* climber shouts _"climbing!"_
