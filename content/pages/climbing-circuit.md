Title: Circuit Exercises for Climbing
Tags: Climbing, Wiki

# Guidelines

* Concentrate on improving body composition and all-around fitness. 
Moderate aerobic training (such as running) and basic conditioning exercises 
will effectively build base fitness.
* Favor body-weight exercises such as pull-ups, push-ups, dips, and 
abdominal crunches over machines or free weights.
* Perform some modest training of the push muscles to maintain muscular balance, 
since the pulling muscles will steadily grow stronger as a result of climbing.
* Engage in regular stretching to improve flexibility and reduce injury risk.
* Climb two to four days per week to develop climbing strength. 
* Resist the urge to engage in the high-intensity, sport-specific exercises 
commonly used by more advanced climbers.

# Strategy

Two sets of each exercise with a weight that produces muscular failure in 15 
to 20 reps.

Execute slowly and without stopping in the middle of the set. 

Make the upward phase last about 1 second and the downward phase 2 seconds. 

Rest 1 to 2 minutes between sets. 

## Bench press

Begin with a total weight equal to about 25% of body weight and progress 
up to 50% (never more).

## Shoulder Press 

Press straight upward with your palms maintaining a forward-facing position. 
As your arms become straight, squeeze your hands slightly inward until 
the dumbbells touch end-to-end.

## Lat Pull-Down 

Grip the bar with your hands shoulder width apart. Many pull-down machines 
possess bars designed for the much wider hand position preferred by bodybuilders
 â€” do not use this wide grip.

## Upright Rows 

Gist: hold the grips with the overhand grip and lift it straight up to the collarbone.

Possible with [the cable machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upright_row).
