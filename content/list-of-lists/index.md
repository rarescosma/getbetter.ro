Title: The Lists of all Lists

Like any cyclical process worth something, an external sphere of knowledge
must first undergo _completely chaotic_ expansion followed by a _somewhat
controlled_ contraction.

The purpose of this page is to grow indefinitely until it encompasses all
the things I've managed to digitally hoard in all the places where digital
hoarding was perpetrated.

Let the expansion begin.

!!! notes
    * __Wounded inner child__ / __inner pain__ == language that's the result of
    the __psychological pop movement__ in the US. The more we're taught to
    _list_ and _resent_ the things of which we were _deprived_ as children,
    the more we live in that anger and frustration, and the more we _remain_
    children.
    * Defining a grown-up is hard because of the conflict between moralist
    standpoint (being a __citizen__) and the appeal to selfish
    self-gratification (being __free__ and doing what you want/love).
    * __Citizen__ might imply you need to learn about your country's history &
    political candidates (by reading stuff).
    * The __political vicious cycle__: if voters are disinterested,  then the
    tendency is for candidates with paid exposure in media to win, which ties
    them to big donors, which makes them corrupt, which will result in even more
    disinterest on the part of the voters, ad nausea.
    * Some people might dread reading not because it's boring, but because it
    implies being alone in a quiet room - which they can't stand.
    * Old horse: the Internet and computer culture sped things up to the point
    where people cannot focus 30 minutes on the same topic, or read for 1 hour
    or listen to an entire album of complex music.
    * The part of ourselves that can live in _quiet_, _without stimulation_ is
    not fed, thus it __atrophies__.
    * __Too much good stuff__ combined with
    [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) is a deadly combo
    as it kills any notion of focus: you always have to switch to the next
    thing because _maybe_ it's just a little bit better.
    * In the face of modern crisis or _hard times_, instead of banding together
    people are now turning to more individualism.
    * __Rebelling meaningfully__ = don't buy a lot of stuff, don't get your view
    of the world from TV, be willing to spend _hours_ researching an election.
