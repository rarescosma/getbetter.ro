Title: The Lists of all Lists

Like any cyclical process worth something, an external sphere of knowledge
must first undergo _completely chaotic_ expansion followed by a _somewhat
controlled_ contraction.

The purpose of this page is to grow indefinitely until it encompasses all
the things I've managed to digitally hoard in all the places where digital
hoarding was perpetrated.

Let the expansion begin.

!!! notes
    * Sloppy thinking transcends international boundaries easily.
    * Disentangling __science__:
        * an intellectual endeavor aimed at the rational understanding of the
        natural and social world
        * a corpus of _currently_ accepted substantive knowledge in various
        fields
        * the community of science (along with its social and economic structure)
        * applied science in technology
    * Focusing on the first two: __science__ == a worldview giving primacy to
    reason and observation + methodology aimed at acquiring accurate knowledge
    of the natural and social world.
    * Critical spirit: commitment to the incessant testing of assertions through
    observations and/or experiments. Revision or discarding of those theories
    that fail the test.
    * All our empirical knowledge is _tentative_, _incomplete_ and __open to
    revision__.
    * Well tested theories are supported by a powerful web of interlocking
    evidence.
    * Progressing science tends to link theories into a unified framework.
    * 1st adversary of science: postmodern relativists. How do they do it?
    By systematically confusing __truth__ with _claim of truth_, __fact__ with
    _assertions of fact_ and __knowledge__ with _pretensions to knowledge_.
    * 2nd adversary of science: complementary and alternative therapies in
    health and medicine: what precisely does it mean to be competent in a system
    of pseudo-medicine that has __never__ been demonstrated to be efficacious beyond
    the placebo effect?
    * Basic principle in science: GIGO - garbage _in_, garbage _out_.
    Systematic biases in studies with flawed methodologies and small sample
    sizes can accumulate into reaching statistical significance when the
    studies are pooled.
    * Non-flawed methodologies should include: adequate __randomization__,
    __double blinding__, predefined outcome measures, clear accounting for
    _dropouts_.
    * 3rd (and very dangerous) adversary of the evidence-based world view:
    __religion__
    * Components of religious doctrines:
        * __factual__: claims about the Universe and its history.
        * __ethical__: prescriptions about how to live.
        * (optional) __epistemological__: methods by which humans can obtain
        reasonable reliable knowledge of factual or ethical matters.
    * Gem of circular reasoning that is the epistemological ground on which
    all "faith" is grounded:
        * __Q:__ Why do you believe fact X?
        * __A:__ Because our holy scriptures say so.
        * __Q:__ How do we know that our holy scriptures are free from error?
        * __A:__ Because the scriptures _themselves_ say so.
    * Faith is not in fact a __rejection__ of reason, but simply a lazy
    __acceptance__ of bad reasons.
    * "Why does Oxford have a faculty of theology, but no faculty of astrology?"
    * Perhaps the currently fashionable ecumenical-sounding euphemism of
    religion, "faith", should be replaced by the epistemological more
    illuminating term "superstition".
    * 4th adversary of science: propagandists, PR flaks & spin doctors along
    with the politicians and corporations who employ them. Their goal is not to
    analyze honestly the evidence for and against a particular policy, but is
    simply to manipulate the public into reaching a predetermined conclusion by
    whatever technique will work, however dishonest or fraudulent.
    * We take for granted the fact that (some) of our politicians lie to us,
    and that's a problem: we've become so cynical that we've lost our ability
    to become appropriately outraged.
    * An invariant in all areas of life is the underlying philosophy of science:
    to constrain our theories as strongly as possible by empirical evidence and
    to modify or reject those theories that fail to conform to the evidence.
    * The natural sciences have had such a profound effect on human culture
    because of this general philosophical lesson, rather than any _specific_
    discoveries.
    * As a logical matter, [one cannot derive an "ought" from an "is"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT7yXG2aJdY), therefore ethics and factual matters are
    logically separate.
    * Historically, scientific skepticism has played the role of an intellectual
    __acid__ - dissolving the irrational beliefs that legitimated the
    _establishment_ (priesthood, monarchy, aristocracy, allegedly superior
    races or social classes).
    * Sadly, 400 years later, the _revolutionary_ transition from a _dogmatic_
    to an __evidence-based__ worldview is very far from being complete...


#### 2020.02.10 - [David Foster Wallace on Responsibility and Maturity (2003)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=dLHoEQSoGLs)

!!! notes
    * __Wounded inner child__ / __inner pain__ == language that's the result of
    the __psychological pop movement__ in the US. The more we're taught to
    _list_ and _resent_ the things of which we were _deprived_ as children,
    the more we live in that anger and frustration, and the more we _remain_
    children.
    * Defining a grown-up is hard because of the conflict between moralist
    standpoint (being a __citizen__) and the appeal to selfish
    self-gratification (being __free__ and doing what you want/love).
    * __Citizen__ might imply you need to learn about your country's history &
    political candidates (by reading stuff).
    * The __political vicious cycle__: if voters are disinterested,  then the
    tendency is for candidates with paid exposure in media to win, which ties
    them to big donors, which makes them corrupt, which will result in even more
    disinterest on the part of the voters, ad nausea.
    * Some people might dread reading not because it's boring, but because it
    implies being alone in a quiet room - which they can't stand.
    * Old horse: the Internet and computer culture sped things up to the point
    where people cannot focus 30 minutes on the same topic, or read for 1 hour
    or listen to an entire album of complex music.
    * The part of ourselves that can live in _quiet_, _without stimulation_ is
    not fed, thus it __atrophies__.
    * __Too much good stuff__ combined with
    [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) is a deadly combo
    as it kills any notion of focus: you always have to switch to the next
    thing because _maybe_ it's just a little bit better.
    * In the face of modern crisis or _hard times_, instead of banding together
    people are now turning to more individualism.
    * __Rebelling meaningfully__ = don't buy a lot of stuff, don't get your view
    of the world from TV, be willing to spend _hours_ researching an election.
