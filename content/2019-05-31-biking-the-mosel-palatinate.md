# Day 1

*Distance* - 56.23km

## Highlights

### Morning at Chris'

Waking up to the reality of having to take Chris' bikes for the trip.
"Fixing" a broken back-wheel spoke on one of the MRBs.
Adjusting seats n' stuff.

Making sandwiches. Thank the Lord for the Resorb pills from Sweden.

### Train ride to T端rkism端hle

Not much to say here except that the landscape is nice and green and the region
seems dotted with quaint villages and good nature.

### T端rkism端hle - Nonnweiler

A nice climb that managed to lift spirits and leave Chris pretty mad b/c of
the shitty bike and heavy backpack.

Eating sandwiches. Changing into the spandex-diaper-pants...

### Nonnweiler - Reinsfeld

A good intended lady in a random field advertising a *the* bike path
to Trier (50km range). Another random old walking couple advertising
the same, going from Reinsfeld apparently. Getting mad in Reinsfeld.

### Reinsfeld - Riveris

Taking lead. Picking a path through the middle of the forest along the Riveris.
An *awesome* ride through the forest that recharged all the karma.
Exiting the forest on a nice downhill ride to find ourselves in a completely
new climatic region. Shit got hot all of a sudden.

### Riveris - Ruwer - Trier

Mostly downhill ride towards Trier. Almost missed a nice bike-dedicated
path going south of Trier and close to the city center. Making it to the
city center + glorious entrance through the Porta Nigra. Chillin' near the
church with some Schnitzels.

# Day 2

*Distance* - 66km

## Highlights

### Trier - Schweich

Started with a monster breakfast at the Trier B&B hotel. Configured the JBL
bluetooth speaker and hopped on the bikes for a short ride towards the city
center & Porta Nigra. Keeping the Porta on the left, rode straight towards
the Kaiser-Wilhelm bridge and the first sighting of the Mosel. A short stair
descent later and we were on the dedicated bike lane that we were gonna stay
on for most of the rest of the trip.

Around Trier-Pfalzel we had to take a detour from the river due to
industrial / recycling activity. After all the Mosel *is* a navigable river
and water transportation has its insane cost benefits over anything else.
But at the end of it all there was a nice marina with small-ish yachts where 
we took a break, listened to Bob Marley and had delicious Ritter chocolates.

### Schweich - Neumagen-Dhron

Met with a random old German couple on e-bikes around Mehring who suggested
we take the bridge across the Mosel for superior views / bike lane.

Sure enough, after the first turn of the river out attention was drawn by
the "Landgasthaus Hungaricum" where we had to indulge in awesome Hungarian
dishes because that's how our "Ardeleni" DNA is wired. 
Needless to say, Chris downed a couple of beers as well.

The next portion up to Neumagen-Dhron was just meandering river turns with
terraced vineyards on both sides and superb landscape. 

One remarkable aspect is that the Germans seem to be very fond of 
the hollywoodian style of advertising their vineyard's names: each terrace
had a logo made of huge white letters propped up. 

### Neumagen-Dhron

Oldest wine-producing village in Germany. The initial plan was to stop here
and sample some Rieslings but in the end we just visited the Roman Fort
nearby the church, chilled a bit, then resumed the tour along the east bank 
in hopes for a better place to stop and chill.

Fun fact about the Roman relics there: they were multi-stage.
Apparently the region was first conquered 12BC, but then the Germanic tribes
took it back and it was not until Constantin's reign that it was recaptured
by Rome. During this second occupation the Romans started re-using most of 
the existing building materials for just essential fortifications, 
so most leisure-oriented buildings were torn down.

### Neumagen-Dhron - Bernkastel-Kues

A good chilling session took place somewhere in the vicinity of Piesport,
on a small private (and marked as such) pier. We just sat there, listened to
some good music, dipped our feet in the cold Mosel water and replenished our
stamina.

Next, we crossed the bridge near Minheim and pushed on towards Bernkastel-Kues
while the afternoon sun was slowly converting its rays towards golden.

Approaching Bernkastel-Kues was easily one of the most epic moments of the trip:
we were on the west bank, the river was almost entirely still and the afternoon
Sun bathed the entire east bank in golden light, providing near perfect
water reflections. Took a ton of photos, nice castle and all.

### Bernkastel-Kues

We approached a nice lady with running a bar right at the entrance of town 
and brokered a more than decent accommodation offer for the night: 70 EUR
total for the three of us.

We then crossed the bridge to get some food on a terrace.
Chris & I ended up ordering 3 portions in total. Hunger levels were high.

The waiter on the terrace was really funny - trying to stay positive and crack
jokes whenever possible despite the ennui of waking up every morning with a
generalized hate for humankind. Mex understood him perfectly. 

Made it back to the accommodation right before deadline and dropped our stuff
in this insane 1649-built medieval house with original timber frames still
in place.

Of course, before going to sleep we cleaned out another couple of beers on
the local terrace.

# Day 3 - TODO

*Distance* - 69.2km

## Bernkastel Kues - Traben-Trarbach

1st breakfast at cafe. Bought an egg. Still wasn't enough. 

Shopping for sunscreen, supermarket breakfast on heavy mayo + fruity supplies.

## Traben-Trarbach - Aussichtsturm Prinzenkopf (Zell)

Bum, under-the-bridge pause in Traben Trarbach.

After crossing the bridge, Mex & I got separated from Chris, as he kept forward
when there were stairs on the left side leading to the waterfront. 

The epic route failure around Aussichtsturm Prinzenkopf.

## Aussichtsturm Prinzenkopf (Zell) - Cochem

Epic descent as well.

Mushroom-shaped guest house.

Arrival & evening in Cochem: gas pump hostel, castel hike, schweinhaxe v2, schlager musik + lots of kolsch,
then balcony / gas station party + bedtime philosophy until 3am.
