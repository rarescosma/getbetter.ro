## Highlights

### Morning at Chris'

Woke up with the belly full of last night's Schweinhaxe, plus a slight 
hangover. Luckily, the swedish Resorb clone pills worked like a charm. 

We had a pretty slow start with coffee, protein shakes and some minimal
breakfast (not in quantity, but in composition), did some abs, 
then starting preparing sandwiches for the trip and inspecting Chris' bikes. 

Apart from small mechanical adjustments we had
to "fix" a broken back-wheel spoke on one of them by completely removing it. 
This turned out to be quite an adventure as the material is hard to bend and
working around the back-wheel cassette quickly became very annoying.

When all was said and done we, of course, had no chance to catch the planned
train trip, so had to take a later train towards Türkismühle.  

### Train ride to Türkismühle

Not much to say here except that the landscape is nice and green and the region
seems dotted with quaint villages and good nature. Also, the Sun came out, 
so we were in for a good trip. Well, there was the extra weight of the rain
gear, but that's just more training, right?

### Türkismühle - Nonnweiler - Reinsfeld

We mostly rode on roads shared with cars on this segment, passed a few small
settlements, had coffee in one of them and took a longer break in another
to eat sandwiches and change into lighter clothes. 

At some point we encountered a really long incline, not at a very steep angle, 
but enough to lift spirits and leave Chris somewhat mad because of his shitty 
bike and heavy backpack. 

We did see a wind turbine up close along the way, which was pretty cool. 

The last stop was in Nonnweiler where I've got a bunch of chocolate from a gas
station. Mex's stomach was still pretty upset about the Schweinhaxe attempt so
medication was in order, along with an extended break. 

Finding the way to the dedicated bike path was somewhat challenging as it rode
close to an old rail line and there were a lot of fenced up areas. Finally, we
took a detour through a small part of town and merged. Escaping cars and going
through the countryside and fields was bliss. 

At some point we passed a bridge over a regional road and met with a good 
intended German lady who was advertising a novel bike path that allegedly went
straight to Trier and was mostly downhill, albeit a bit longer (50km). This
got our attention, especially after we've also met with a random old walking 
couple who re-confirmed its existence and told us to just take the car road 
back to Reinsfeld and look for this bike path.

We did that, but once in Reinsfeld the atmosphere got very negative 
because of inconsistencies in Google Maps and the inability to converge on a 
good plan to proceed. There was the first mention of throwing Gorgan's 
bike into the Mosel. 

### Reinsfeld - Riveris

It was at this point that I took lead and picked a path through the middle 
of the forest along the (aptly named) river Riveris.
This turned out to be a very good decision as the forest road was surrounded
by really lush forest areas and generally following the course of the river. 

The light/shadow, forest/meadow and water/land/sky interplay together with the
added technical challenge of the trail completely changed the karma balance of
the group and by the time we were about to exit into the Mosel valley region
everyone was just blissfully happy. 

The entire adventure was topped off with a nice downhill ride merging into the
road to Morscheid & Waldrach - both settlements within the climatic influence
of the Mosel. This influence is quite heavy: there were 18-19C where we entered
the forest, and around 24-25C where we exited. Transcedence. Also, time for
a stop to shed even more clothing. 

### Riveris - Ruwer - Trier

Mostly downhill ride towards Trier. Almost missed a nice bike-dedicated
path going south of Trier and close to the city center. Making it to the
city center + glorious entrance through the Porta Nigra. Chillin' near the
church with some Schnitzels.

# Day 2 - the 23rd of May, 2019

*Distance* - 66km

## Highlights

### Trier - Schweich

Started with a monster breakfast at the Trier B&B hotel. Configured the JBL
bluetooth speaker and hopped on the bikes for a short ride towards the city
center & Porta Nigra. Keeping the Porta on the left, rode straight towards
the Kaiser-Wilhelm bridge and the first sighting of the Mosel. A short stair
descent later and we were on the dedicated bike lane that we were gonna stay
on for most of the rest of the trip.

Around Trier-Pfalzel we had to take a detour from the river due to
industrial / recycling activity. After all the Mosel *is* a navigable river
and water transportation has its insane cost benefits over anything else.
But at the end of it all there was a nice marina with small-ish yachts where 
we took a break, listened to Bob Marley and had delicious Ritter chocolates.

### Schweich - Neumagen-Dhron

Met with a random old German couple on e-bikes around Mehring who suggested
we take the bridge across the Mosel for superior views / bike lane.

Sure enough, after the first turn of the river out attention was drawn by
the "Landgasthaus Hungaricum" where we had to indulge in awesome Hungarian
dishes because that's how our "Ardeleni" DNA is wired. 
Needless to say, Chris downed a couple of beers as well.

The next portion up to Neumagen-Dhron was just meandering river turns with
terraced vineyards on both sides and superb landscape. 

One remarkable aspect is that the Germans seem to be very fond of 
the hollywoodian style of advertising their vineyard's names: each terrace
had a logo made of huge white letters propped up. 

### Neumagen-Dhron

Oldest wine-producing village in Germany. The initial plan was to stop here
and sample some Rieslings but in the end we just visited the Roman Fort
nearby the church, chilled a bit, then resumed the tour along the east bank 
in hopes for a better place to stop and chill.

Fun fact about the Roman relics there: they were multi-stage.
Apparently the region was first conquered 12BC, but then the Germanic tribes
took it back and it was not until Constantin's reign that it was recaptured
by Rome. During this second occupation the Romans started re-using most of 
the existing building materials for just essential fortifications, 
so most leisure-oriented buildings were torn down.

### Neumagen-Dhron - Bernkastel-Kues

A good chilling session took place somewhere in the vicinity of Piesport,
on a small private (and marked as such) pier. We just sat there, listened to
some good music, dipped our feet in the cold Mosel water and replenished our
stamina.

Next, we crossed the bridge near Minheim and pushed on towards Bernkastel-Kues
while the afternoon sun was slowly converting its rays towards golden.

Approaching Bernkastel-Kues was easily one of the most epic moments of the trip:
we were on the west bank, the river was almost entirely still and the afternoon
Sun bathed the entire east bank in golden light, providing near perfect
water reflections. Took a ton of photos, nice castle and all.

### Bernkastel-Kues

We approached a nice lady with running a bar right at the entrance of town 
and brokered a more than decent accommodation offer for the night: 70 EUR
total for the three of us.

We then crossed the bridge to get some food on a terrace.
Chris & I ended up ordering 3 portions in total. Hunger levels were high.

The waiter on the terrace was really funny - trying to stay positive and crack
jokes whenever possible despite the ennui of waking up every morning with a
generalized hate for humankind. Mex understood him perfectly. 

Made it back to the accommodation right before deadline and dropped our stuff
in this insane 1649-built medieval house with original timber frames still
in place.

Of course, before going to sleep we cleaned out another couple of beers on
the local terrace.

# Day 3 - the 24th of May, 2019

*Distance* - 69.2km

## Bernkastel Kues - Traben-Trarbach

The previously unmentioned snorring issues were greatly ameliorated during
the night by isolating Chris into his own bed - definitely a winning strategy. 

We got up relatively early (around 8:00), got ready, dropped the key in the 
postbox and moved out to catch some breakfast at the closest cafe. You'd think
a basic sandwich and an extra boiled egg would fit the bill, but it was far
from enough. 

Noticing the extreme biker's tan that I've managed to acquire so far I've 
decided to veer off towards the city center and look for some sunscreen. 
A fortunate decision since the pharmacy was quite close to supermarket, where
we all got our second breakfast and got some super-fruity supplies as well. 

1st breakfast at cafe. Bought an extra boiled egg. Still wasn't enough. 

Shopping for sunscreen, supermarket breakfast (heavy mayo, wtf) + super-fruity 
supplies.

## Traben-Trarbach - Aussichtsturm Prinzenkopf (Zell)

Bum-lile, under-the-bridge break in Traben Trarbach + marginal exploration. 

After crossing the bridge, Mex & I got separated from Chris, as he kept forward
when there were stairs on the left side leading to the waterfront. 

The epic routing failure around Aussichtsturm Prinzenkopf. 2nd to the left
was a longer, but asphalt smooth road to the top, 1st to the left was hell.

Got there so early compared to Chris & Mex that I was able to squeeze in a 20
minute nap. 

## Aussichtsturm Prinzenkopf (Zell) - Cochem

EPIC descent. 

Mushroom-shaped guest house. 

Breaking another back-wheel spoke.

Arrival & evening in Cochem: gas pump hostel, castel hike, schweinhaxe v2, 
schlager musik + lots of kolsch, then balcony / gas station party + drunken 
philosophy until 3AM.
