# The BE FAST Method

### B - Belief

> If you don't believe you can or if you believe you can't, you're right.

Avoid mental blocks by believing you can do better.

Simple imagination exercise involving a lateral hand stretch:

* stretch right hand to the back
* close eyes and imagine stretching the hand 2-3-4 times as farther as you did
the first time
* open eyes and stretch again => you should go much further just by having
altered your belief state


### E - Exercise (as your body moves your brain grooves)

Neural elasticity comes from a healthy body. An active lifestyle pays off.

A nice similitude between working out:

* breaking the muscles out of the comfort zone (by activating them)
* and then feeding them with the correct nutrients

and learning:

* breaking the current state to go into superior states:
joy, peace, happiness, fascination, curiosity
* feeding the brain with new information


### F - Forget (beginner's mindset)

A common roadblock for learning is not adopting a beginner's mindset. If you
*think* you already know something well enough you're less likely to pick up
new information about the subject fast.

> Your mind is like a parachute. It only works when it's open.

Forget what you already know about the subject.

Forget about anything that's not urgent and important.
You can't multitask.
If your brain is thinking about 4 different things,
you're not fully present – so you won't learn.

Forget your limitations.


### A - Active (learning is not a spectator's sport)

Learning is more effective when you engage: ask better questions and take better
notes.

You learn by creating information and being active in the process.


### S - State (all learning is state dependent)

Information combined with emotion becomes a long-term memory.

Therefore it is paramount to be in a superior mood when learning.

Fun fact: a lot of people don't remember what they learned in school
because the umbrella emotion for most of them was boredom.

Improving state:

* change your posture or your body or breathing
* sit or stand the way you would if you were totally energized
* think about how you’ll benefit from the information

Instead of being clever during the class, aim to be bewildered by the new
information.


### T - Teach (when you teach something you get to learn it twice)

Learn with the intention of teaching it to somebody else.

Pretend you had to give a presentation of what you've learned today:

* you'd ask better questions
* you'd take more detailed notes
* you'd pay closer attention
