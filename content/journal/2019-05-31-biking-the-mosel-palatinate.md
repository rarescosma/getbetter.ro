## Day 1 - the 22nd of May, 2019

### Morning at Chris'

I woke up with the belly full of last night's Schweinhaxe, plus a slight
hangover. Luckily, the swedish Resorb clone pills worked like a charm.

We had a pretty slow start with coffee, protein shakes and some minimal
breakfast (not in quantity, but in composition), did some abs,
then starting preparing sandwiches for the trip and inspecting Chris' bikes.

Apart from small mechanical adjustments we had
to "fix" a broken back-wheel spoke on one of them by completely removing it.
This turned out to be quite an adventure as the material is hard to bend and
working around the back-wheel cassette quickly became very annoying.

When all was said and done we, of course, had no chance to catch the planned
train trip, so had to take a later train towards Türkismühle.

### Train ride to Türkismühle

Not much to say here except that the landscape is nice and green and the region
seems dotted with quaint villages and good nature. Also, the Sun came out,
so we were in for a good trip. Well, there was the extra weight of the rain
gear, but that's just more training, right?

### Türkismühle - Nonnweiler - Reinsfeld

We mostly rode on roads shared with cars on this segment, passed a few small
settlements, had coffee in one of them and took a longer break in another
to eat sandwiches and change into lighter clothes.

At some point we encountered a really long incline, not at a very steep angle,
but enough to lift spirits and leave Chris somewhat mad because of his shitty
bike and heavy backpack.

We did see a wind turbine up close along the way, which was pretty cool.

The last stop was in Nonnweiler where I've got a bunch of chocolate from a gas
station. Mex's stomach was still pretty upset about the Schweinhaxe attempt so
medication was in order, along with an extended break.

Finding the way to the dedicated bike path was somewhat challenging as it rode
close to an old rail line and there were a lot of fenced up areas. Finally, we
took a detour through a small part of town and merged. Escaping cars and going
through the countryside and fields was bliss.

At some point we passed a bridge over a regional road and met with a good
intended German lady who was advertising a novel bike path that allegedly went
straight to Trier and was mostly downhill, albeit a bit longer (50km). This
got our attention, especially after we've also met with a random old walking
couple who re-confirmed its existence and told us to just take the car road
back to Reinsfeld and look for this bike path.

We did that, but once in Reinsfeld the atmosphere got very negative
because of inconsistencies in Google Maps and the inability to converge on a
good plan to proceed. There was the first mention of throwing Gorgan's
bike into the Mosel.

### Reinsfeld - Riveris

It was at this point that I took lead and picked a path through the middle
of the forest along the (aptly named) river Riveris.
This turned out to be a very good decision as the forest road was surrounded
by really lush forest areas and generally following the course of the river.

The light/shadow, forest/meadow and water/land/sky interplay together with the
added technical challenge of the trail completely changed the karma balance of
the group and by the time we were about to exit into the Mosel valley region
everyone was just blissfully happy.

The entire adventure was topped off with a nice downhill ride merging into the
road to Morscheid & Waldrach - both settlements within the climatic influence
of the Mosel. This influence is quite heavy: there were 18-19C where we entered
the forest, and around 24-25C where we exited. Transcendence. Also, time for
a stop to shed even more clothing.

### Riveris - Ruwer - Trier

Mostly downhill ride towards Trier. Almost missed a nice bike-dedicated
path going south of Trier and close to the city center. Making it to the
city center + glorious entrance through the Porta Nigra. Chillin' near the
church with some Schnitzels.

## Day 2 - the 23rd of May, 2019

### Trier - Schweich

Started with a monster breakfast at the Trier B&B hotel. Configured the JBL
bluetooth speaker and hopped on the bikes for a short ride towards the city
center & Porta Nigra. Keeping the Porta on the left, rode straight towards
the Kaiser-Wilhelm bridge and the first sighting of the Mosel. A short stair
descent later and we were on the dedicated bike lane that we were gonna stay
on for most of the rest of the trip.

Around Trier-Pfalzel we had to take a detour from the river due to
industrial / recycling activity. After all the Mosel *is* a navigable river
and water transportation has its insane cost benefits over anything else.
But at the end of it all there was a nice marina with small-ish yachts where
we took a break, listened to Bob Marley and had delicious Ritter chocolates.

### Schweich - Neumagen-Dhron

Met with a random old German couple on e-bikes around Mehring who suggested
we take the bridge across the Mosel for superior views / bike lane.

Sure enough, after the first turn of the river out attention was drawn by
the "Landgasthaus Hungaricum" where we had to indulge in awesome Hungarian
dishes because that's how our "Ardeleni" DNA is wired.
Needless to say, Chris downed a couple of beers as well.

The next portion up to Neumagen-Dhron was just meandering river turns with
terraced vineyards on both sides and superb landscape.

One remarkable aspect is that the Germans seem to be very fond of
the hollywoodian style of advertising their vineyard's names: each terrace
had a logo made of huge white letters propped up.

### Neumagen-Dhron

Oldest wine-producing village in Germany. The initial plan was to stop here
and sample some Rieslings but in the end we just visited the Roman Fort
nearby the church, chilled a bit, then resumed the tour along the east bank
in hopes for a better place to stop and chill.

Fun fact about the Roman relics there: they were multi-stage.
Apparently the region was first conquered 12BC, but then the Germanic tribes
took it back and it was not until Constantin's reign that it was recaptured
by Rome. During this second occupation the Romans started re-using most of
the existing building materials for just essential fortifications,
so most leisure-oriented buildings were torn down.

### Neumagen-Dhron - Bernkastel-Kues

A good chilling session took place somewhere in the vicinity of Piesport,
on a small private (and marked as such) pier. We just sat there, listened to
some good music, dipped our feet in the cold Mosel water and replenished our
stamina.

Next, we crossed the bridge near Minheim and pushed on towards Bernkastel-Kues
while the afternoon sun was slowly converting its rays towards golden.

Approaching Bernkastel-Kues was easily one of the most epic moments of the trip:
we were on the west bank, the river was almost entirely still and the afternoon
Sun bathed the entire east bank in golden light, providing near perfect
water reflections. Took a ton of photos, nice castle and all.

### Bernkastel-Kues

We approached a nice lady with running a bar right at the entrance of town
and brokered a more than decent accommodation offer for the night: 70 EUR
total for the three of us.

We then crossed the bridge to get some food on a terrace.
Chris & I ended up ordering 3 portions in total. Hunger levels were high.

The waiter on the terrace was really funny - trying to stay positive and crack
jokes whenever possible despite the ennui of waking up every morning with a
generalized hate for humankind. Mex understood him perfectly.

Made it back to the accommodation right before deadline and dropped our stuff
in this insane 1649-built medieval house with original timber frames still
in place.

Of course, before going to sleep we cleaned out another couple of beers on
the local terrace.

## Day 3 - the 24th of May, 2019

### Bernkastel-Kues - Traben-Trarbach

The previously unmentioned snoring issues were greatly ameliorated during
the night by isolating Chris into his own bed - definitely a winning strategy.

We got up relatively early (around 8:00), got ready, dropped the key in the
postbox and moved out to catch some breakfast at the closest cafe. You'd think
a basic sandwich and an extra boiled egg would fit the bill, but it was far
from enough.

Noticing the extreme biker's tan that I've managed to acquire so far I've
decided to veer off towards the city center and look for some sunscreen.
A fortunate decision since the pharmacy was quite close to supermarket, where
we all got our second breakfast and got some super-fruity supplies as well.

A couple of kilometers before Traben-Trarback we passed under a *massive*
suspended concrete bridge. Say what you will about medieval / antic structures
being prettier, but sometimes their modern counterparts are just unbelievable.
(well, for the engineering part anyway)

### Traben-Trarbach - Aussichtsturm Prinzenkopf (Zell)

Just like bums, we chilled a bit under the main bridge of Traben-Trarbach once
reaching this fine establishment. The Mosel runs quite wide here and there was
some boat traffic - good for photos.

This is also the first place where one member got completely separated from
the group: Chris picked up (yet another) phone call while crossing the bridge
and failed to notice the stairs leading back to the waterfront on its left.
No worries, the gang got reunited couple of hundred meters downstream.

Next up was a regular ~15km segment in the direction of Zell, a place where
the river turns abruptly to the south-east, then back to the north-west again
in a chicane enclosing some very high grounds. What better place to build a
cloister and an observation tower? And built them they have. We've decided
to cut the corner here, and skip the entire chicane, but go up into the
Aussichtsturm Prinzenkopf for some awesome views of the valley below.

Google Maps was drunk again and it tried to lead us up a dirt path towards
the tower. We decided to ignore that and keep forward. Then we met with a bunch
of Romanian field workers who said the best way is to turn left at the end
of a straight segment and take the asphalt road up. This showed up on Maps
as the *second* turn to the right. As this was on a mild incline, I gained
some distance and at stopped at the crux to look for the others. They vanished.

I kept on, took the left turn and climbed some more to reach a nice place with
one of those oversize wooden benches where you can lay down with the entire
body. Phoning Mex & Chris I found out that they have decided (on their own) to
skip the incline and take the *first* turn to the left instead as it appeared
to be shorter.

Honestly, I was a bit disappointed in their decision to abandon
their leader, but pushed on and was chilling in the observation tower shortly
thereafter. They ended up missing the road completely, pushing their bikes up
through vines and berries and having to stop at the cloister for water before
finally making it to the tower. I had enough time to take all the nice photos
and also nap for 20 minutes, hahah. It was extremely fun to have the entire
tower for myself, have chocolate and fruit, set up some nice chilling music on
the bluetooth speaker and simply phase out.

### Aussichtsturm Prinzenkopf (Zell) - Cochem

As we've gained around 120m of altitude climbing to the tower, an epic descent
followed: passing through the forest, a couple of villages and a section of Alf.

There was a very interesting event house along the way - it's guest house
(or whatever the structure was) was shaped and decorated as a giant mushroom.

The next two ~16km segments where super-smooth - we were basically surrounded
on all sides by endless vineyards, quaint villages, greenery and the
ever-so-slowly flowing Mosel.

A couple of kilometers before reaching the center of Cochem I heard a weird
popping noise and the back-wheel started making clanging sounds: turns out I'd
managed to break another back-wheel spoke. No coincidence that it was exactly
diametrically opposed to the one we removed before setting off. We removed one
half of it and continued - but so did the clanging sound, which we simply
ignored.

At some point I could not take it anymore so we stopped to have a closer
look and it turned out the hub-side half of the broken spoke was still there
and clanging randomly against the transmission. It could've locked the disk
break completely and with it the entire wheel. Luckily, that had not happened.
We took our time to remove it properly this time around.

### Cochem

We used booking.com again to find some accommodation that was conveniently close
to the train station as we were on a tight schedule the following day.

After dropping the bikes and backpacks we hiked under threat of rain up to the
11th century medieval castle and explored the fortifications for a while. The
views and the castle itself were spectacular.

Then it was back to the city center to find some food as we were all ravenous
after biking 70km. (and some of us pushing bikes through vines)
Of course I had to have my second serving oh Schweinhaxe - which I slowly
proceeded to clean out. Chris was very impressed with my ability to finish it,
contrary to all belief.

After the meal we were in the mood for beers. We tried to convince Mex to join
for a few, but he went home to preserve his stomach. Obviously, the only natural
choice for Chris & I was to go for a Schlager Musik party in a popular local
bar and have 6 or so Kölsch beers each. Properly imbibed with both beer and
party spirit we headed home around 1:30AM, then partied on the balcony for a
while, right above the gas station and then engaging in drunken philosophy
until 3AM.

The end. Wake up.
