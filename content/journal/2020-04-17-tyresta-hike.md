Title: Overnight hammocking in Tyresta

Stockholmers are spoilt: very close to the city lies the beautiful
[Tyresta National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyresta_National_Park),
home to one of the largest coniferous
[old-growth forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest) in Sweden.

Thus, 3 friends and I decided to do a weekend hike through Tyresta including
an overnight stay.

## Day 1 - Friday, the 17th of April, 2020

### Approach

We met at 13:00 at Gullmarsplan and took the 13:30 bus to Nyfors (number 873).
This put us within walking distance of the northern entry into Tyresta, part
of the [Kungsleden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kungsleden)
and [Sörmlandsleden](http://www.sormlandsleden.se/) trails.

We entered the reservation through a bridge to the West, and followed the
Sörmlandsleden until it intersected the North-South power line. Before reaching
lake Årsjön we turned directly to the East, aiming to reach the tip of lake
Långsjön.

### Lakes Långsjön & Mörtsjön

The lake has an elongated shape on the North-South axis.
We would follow along its eastern shore for great views and also direct
sunlight, as the Sun was now deep to the West.

Crossing the tip of the lake from  West to East turned out problematic as the
lake ends in a marsh that seems to be fed by precipitation accumulation from
the surrounding forest. We were looking for a way to not have to go too much
to the North to find the end of this wetland, but failing that decided to
make a cross anyway and got our feet wet.

There was even a half-assed attempt at moving a fallen log over the wetland
to construct a bridge but we soon realized that: (a) we don't have enough
oomph to actually move the log in place and (b) walking on it would require
great amounts of balance and equilibrium.

But all this stuff doesn't matter when you take in your surroundings. The
beauty of the Northern part of the Tyresta forest is unfathomable. There is
old growth everywhere, roots are covered with green lush moss, and the interplay
of Sunlight between the branches gives everything extra depth and contrast.
Also, the area is quite bouldery so it's a very good exercise to ascend to high
points and go back into valleys.

There is also a smaller lake to the South of Långsjön called Mörtsjön, with a
more familiar round shape.

### Lake Stensjön & the Osprey's Nest

Our final objective was reaching the camping spot on the Northwestern shore
of lake Stensjön. Once we reached its Northern shore we stumbled upon a very
technical route with lots of bouldering crests interspersed with deep valleys.

Navigating this route payed off: we managed to find the remains of some old
viking fortifications and a nice lookout point with great views over 3 northern
islands known as the ["Osprey's Nest"](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Northern+Stensj%C3%B6n+with+a+view+of+the+osprey+nest./@59.1852351,18.3115059,287m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m8!1m2!6m1!1s1yUdqUGywtC1ydAfHgEq-44aV4Si3Dw2t!3m4!1s0x465f7d3f672b58d5:0x2ba3d8760ef1c12d!8m2!3d59.1861452!4d18.3123482).

After this lookout we had to retreat from the northern shore as boulders
formed a direct cliff to the water.We backtracked until finding a west-east
trail which led all the way to the camping site.

### Camping out

Finding a proper place to hang the hammock was definitely not my top priority.
Instead, I picked a shoreline spot overlooking the lake, its westernmost island,
and the setting Sun and deployed there.
The [Whoopie suspension system](https://www.ddhammocks.com/product/suspensionsystem)
used by DD hammocks makes for a very fast deploy as it doesn't require any knot
tying.

After chilling in the hammock for a while I scouted a spot to hang it over night
that would offer slight wind protection. The trick is to hang parallel to the
shoreline so the tarp is effective against the breeze to/from the water.

Opening the tarp bag also offered a nice surprise: it doesn't include a
suspension rope! And I was also dumb enough to buy some elastic rope from Clas
Ohlson the day before the trip but obviously did't pack it. Salvation came
from a couple of ropes I riped out the food bag and tied them together with
a rope from a friend's backpack. This was also a great oportunity to figure
out a simple self-tying knot for joining ropes. For greater loads than a tarp,
however, the [double fisherman's bend](https://www.animatedknots.com/double-fishermans-bend-knot)
is recommended.

The camping site includes a stone-walled fireplace surrounded by a hexagon of
wooden benches, which is nice. Firewood is also provided in a box further
North on the road, which we obviously missed so there was a lot of hatchet
action instead to split wood.

We drank beers, cooked hotdogs and chorizos, chatted about random stuff and
huddled around the fire as the temperature slowly dropped to 1-2°C. Time flies
when you're having fun and soon it was 2AM so we went to sleep.

### The night

Sleeping in a hammock is surprisingly cozy. The air mat provided for extra
cushioning and the winter sleeping bag (-5°C comfort, -12°C extreme) was enough
to twarth hypothermia. However, at around 5AM, I woke up with a nagging cold
sensation around my navel. Turns out condensation had formed _inside_ the
air mat and it obviously accumulated around the midpoint making things there
a bit damp and cold. I solved the issue by layering another blanket in between
and went back to sleep.

## Day 2 - Saturday, the 18th of April, 2020 (TODO)

Structure:

* breakfast
* trail to the Baltic
* Lillströmsträsk
* lunch + hike towards Raksta
* nevermind Raksta - trail back to Nyfors

## Lessons learned

* Bring rope. Always. Bring it. Always bring rope.
* Do *NOT* inflate air mats with your mouth. This leads to condensation in
colder temperatures. Use the provided pump instead.
* Gas stoves are more reliable than alchohol stoves.
* Close the top end of the sleeping bag as good as possible.
* "Last time I went my beer weighed more than my gear. I soon learned that whisky works better."
* Or perhaps let others carry their own friggin' alcohol next time. I don't even like drinking.
* Water filters are pretty cool. [Get one.](https://www.naturkompaniet.se/grayl-geopress-purifier-camo-black-2082384/?sku=852703004584)
* Camelbaks are also pretty cool for maintaining hydration.
* Having base ingredients + stove might weight in less than bringing pre-cooked
food (you can also get rid of rigid containers and use bags).
* Having extra extra dry socks is good, especially when marshlands suddenly
become attractive.
* Independence gradient: increase cooking + firemaking gear (aka stove + axe).
* Hiking in longjohns sucks. But they're still good for sleeping.
* Knot practice:
