Title: Summiting a Sonfjällets peak + Norway drive-through

## Pointillist memories

### Day 1
* got into a big-arse Volvo, picked my friend up and drove to [Sonfjällets](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Parkering+Sonfj%C3%A4llets+Nationalpark/@62.2066692,11.3396204,8.67z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4613db49feb63f81:0xda2799d4288ffec7!2sKristiansund,+Norway!3b1!8m2!3d63.1103346!4d7.7280789!3m4!1s0x466ed76d2fa51f53:0x3608bd9d3332e237!8m2!3d62.3173348!4d13.5643988) nature reserve
* stopped in Gävle to get some supplies (and a beaver, which turned into the trip's mascot)
* several icecream stops later we were in the parking lot
* was getting kinda late so decided to hike up the hill until the ground leveled to camp-able levels and deploy the camp

### Day 2
* stashed the backpacks next day and went for the summit
* weird triangle shaped summit structure
* good views over the Swedish flatlands
* nice weather, had a little race on the way back to the basecamp, then a very steep climb off
* back to car, decided to drive to Norway (because it was right there)
* simulation detail level increased considerably once we crossed the border
* met with some moose who were just chilling on the road
* had a nice lunch (dinner?) at a [hotel overlooking a lake](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Skarvruets+H%C3%B6gfj%C3%A4llshotell/@62.2066692,11.3396204,8.67z/data=!4m16!1m7!3m6!1s0x4613db49feb63f81:0xda2799d4288ffec7!2sKristiansund,+Norway!3b1!8m2!3d63.1103346!4d7.7280789!3m7!1s0x466c1dc9152fa82f:0xbc7eb023de83de15!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d62.5392445!4d12.408371); girls helped with phone charging, took some stinky cheese for dessert
* over the border drove around, found a [camping spot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/62%C2%B041'27.7%22N+11%C2%B028'07.8%22E/@62.733382,10.7766849,10.38z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4613db49feb63f81:0xda2799d4288ffec7!2sKristiansund,+Norway!3b1!8m2!3d63.1103346!4d7.7280789!3m4!1s0x0:0xb7992aea3af5d4fd!8m2!3d62.6910414!4d11.4688683), tried to pay but couldn't figure out Norwegian swish
* camping spot even had a little beach + some weird electrical posts jutting from the middle of the lake

### Day 3
* drove to Trondheim, had some sandwiches on the Atlantic shore
* took an the Atlantic road down, passing through Spongdal, Øydegard, Kristiansund, etc.
* chilled at the awesome [Storseisundet Bridge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Storseisundet+Bridge/@63.0270044,7.927473,9.46z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4612d32b233dd8a3:0xa805a3c934506949!2s7074+Spongdal,+Norway!3b1!8m2!3d63.3556326!4d10.166428!3m4!1s0x4611600bdf7b89cd:0x21078c12f9de5428!8m2!3d63.0165899!4d7.3528747)
* took a last minute booking at a Cadillac, "50's were the greatest", "'Murica" sort of dude
* his wife was definitely running things, but the dude was just handy and built a ton of cabins for tourists
* he even had a favorite cabin, criterion being the way the Sun hits it when it rises
* played with a giant Norwegian pussy

### Day 4
* lost a bunch of time driving against Google and reaching a dead-end
* no worries though
* lots of fjords, don't remember exactly but this is when we found out about the massive 40kg apricot production of a fjord farm near the 7 Sisters waterfall
* Magerholm, Urke, Øye, Hellesylt, Geiranger, Stryn and finally to Brikdalsbre
* guerilla camping in a thick forest patch near the glacial river
* thank the Lawd for earplugs

### Day 5
* saw a glacier, dipped feet in its glacial lake
* very cool waterfalls, loud too!
* lots of driving
* almost smashed some sheep, a rabit and a gang of racoons
* run, rabbit, run!
* Ole, ole, ole, oleeeeee
* toll road, very empty

### Day 6
* back to the low-res simulation
* but very nice to have varied berry picking opportunities at pit stops
* almost died when overtaking
