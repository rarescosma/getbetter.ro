Title: Hiking progress around Stockholm

Decided to bind together some photo galleries, as well as some experiences from
the hikes we did after [Tyresta](https://getbetter.ro/journal/2020-04-17-tyresta-hike/).

## 04.11 - Tyresta

### Experiences

* First hike with the [65L Osprey](https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/camping-and-hiking/backpacks-backpacking/osprey-atmos-65-ag) - amazing suspension, awesome camelbak
* Didn't even bring a knife to sharpen sticks for hotdogs :-(
* Viking fire lay worked very well in windy conditions
* Random dude on the other side of the lake navigating through seemingly
impossible terrain while looking at his phone
* Pack of napkins accidentally thrown into the lake

## 05.02 - Paradiset

### Experiences

* Monet-like sunset
* [Gomboy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8OGM88) is an absolute beast
* Starting fires does actually require a fair amount of sticks and pencils
* It's fairly easy to cook yummy chorizo + garlic + oil + jalapeno dinner
* Facing the A-frame of the tarp towards water is not necessarily bad, it
actually doesn't matter at all when camping on shore of inland lakes, and the
view is so much better
* Managed to lose a spork: from now on everything I pack should either be
intrinsically reflective or get a paracord lanyard
* Some very nice music from Markus

## 05.09 - Björnö

### Photos

### Experiences

* Not cool to lose pack members
* It is possible to camp really close to the sea if shielded by trees
* Blood moon was awesome
* Some very nice music from Andrew
* Double check if you packed the pocket flask

## 05.21 - Ornö

### Photos

{{ gallery("2020.05.21.ornö") }}

### Experiences

* Keep your dominant leg behind when hitting/splitting/fucking up logs with
two-handed swings
* It's possible to pack for 1 night in 20L, but definitely not enough room
for culinary spoiling
* Bring the 65-er ffs
* Rotate ferro rods to avoid permanent damage from the knife edge
* Build wooden base for storing fuel above ground to avoid moisture creeping in
* Get: hiking towel, <del>thermal pad</del>, <del>wool shirts</del>, ...,
large titanium saucepan (to be used as plate too)
* Wood stove is friggin' amazing if the weather / fuel situation permits it
* Ridgeline: move Prusiks on other side of Bowline
*before* tightening up with hitch
* Should clean up water filter at home after usage
* Do not use gloves when filling up water filter
* Humans are mostly stupid and uncooperative (sic)
* Need compass + offline maps
* Learn the [tripod](https://www.animatedknots.com/tripod-lashing-knot) + [square](https://www.animatedknots.com/square-lashing-knot) lashings
* Wind situation is much milder when camping inland
* Need to find a way to avoid/clean some of the grease from Ti cookware
(small metallic brush?)
* Use sunscreen

## 05.30 - Tyresta

### Photos

### Experiences

* Focus on better hydration during walk segments (perhaps try to fill camelbak
instead of filter)
* Don't be leavin' that Morakniv on the forest floor
* Prusiks + carbines rock
* Don't put scorching hot titanium parts on top of textile sleeves
* No more ketchup + senap, go with spring onions instead
* Dry fatwood is really nice to get the fire going
* Still need a plate
* Have spare batteries
* Have drumliner trash bags
