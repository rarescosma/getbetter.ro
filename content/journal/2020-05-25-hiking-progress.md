Title: Hiking progress around Stockholm

Decided to bind together some photo galleries, as well as some experiences from
the hikes we did after [Tyresta](https://getbetter.ro/journal/2020-04-17-tyresta-hike/).

## 04.11 - Tyresta

### Photos

### Experiences

* First hike with the 65L Osprey - amazing suspension, awesome camelbak
* Didn't even bring a knife to sharpen sticks for hotdogs
* Viking fire lay worked very well in windy conditions
* Random dude on the other side of the lake navigating through seemingly
impossible terrain while looking at his phone
* Pack of napkins accidentally thrown into the lake

## 05.02 - Paradiset

### Experiences

* Monet-like sunset
* Gombhoy is an absolute beast
* Starting fires does actually require a fair amount of sticks and pencils
* It's fairly easy to cook yummy chorizo + garlic + oil + jalapeno dinner
* Facing the A-frame of the tarp towards water is not necessarily bad, it
actually doesn't matter at all when camping on shore of inland lakes, and the
view is so much better
* Managed to lose a spork: from now on everything I pack should either be
intrinsically reflective or get a paracord lanyard
* Some very nice music from Markus

## 05.09 - Björnö

### Photos

### Experiences

* Not cool to lose pack members
* It is possible to camp really close to the sea if shielded by trees
* Blood moon was awesome
* Some very nice music from Andrew
* Double check if you packed the pocket flask

## 05.21 - Ornö

### Photos

### Experiences

* Keep your dominant leg behind when hitting/splitting/fucking up logs with two-handed swings
* It's possible to pack for 1 night in 20L, but definitely not enough room for culinary spoiling
* Bring the 65-er ffs
* Rotate ferro rods to avoid permanent damage from the knife edge
* Build wooden base for storing fuel above ground to avoid moisture creeping in
* Get: hiking towel, thermal pad, wool shirts, ..., large titanium saucepan (to be used as plate too)
* Wood stove is friggin' amazing if the weather / fuel situation permits it
* Ridgeline: move Prusiks on other side of Bowline *before* tightening up with hitch
* Should clean up water filter at home after usage
* Do not use gloves when filling up water filter
* Humans are mostly stupid and uncooperative (sic)
* Need compass + offline maps
* Learn the tripod + diagonal lashings
* Wind situation is much milder when camping inland
* Need to find a way to avoid/clean some of the grease from Ti cookware (small metallic brush?)
* Use sunscreen
