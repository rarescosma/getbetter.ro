Title: Hiking progress around Sweden

Decided to bind together some photo galleries, as well as some experiences from
the hikes we did before & after [the great Tyresta hike](https://getbetter.ro/journal/2020-04-17-tyresta-hike/).

## 07.18 - 2020: A Nyn√§shamn Odyssey

### Experiences

* Smooth pendel 43 ride
* Lunch at [Lydia](https://goo.gl/maps/Jc3kkA6sevpuAz837) - waiter tried to
serve us burgers, but we wanted the planstek, so planstek we got -
very nice plate arrangement.
Fresh sage goes well with steaks & the mashed potatoes were delish.
* Got supplies from Coop. Went with spring onions + sweet potatoes for veggies,
also a jar of cornichons, the traditional baguettes for fish tins and some
coconut milk for breakfast. (Note: should bring more stuff to share next time -
tins at least if not full breakfast portions,
or maybe just initialize the peanut butter / nutella tubes)
* Coconut matcha for energy and off we went with a bus to take us closer
to the starting point
* An alco lady held court the entire bus ride, preaching to an alco couple. Oh well.
* Segment of road shared with cars, then we entered the forest and started our trail down to the lake
* A bit clumsy to synchronize walking with trekking poles, but we're getting there
* Summited Vinsberget, the highest point on the mass land, at a whooping altitude of 67 meters
* Took a swim near a [boat mooring point](https://goo.gl/maps/5BQWZ1ve5UZRqPuY9)
to get the core temp down a bit and shared some sardine tins (delicacy!)
* Pushed on through the in-between to the Rassatr√§sk lake
* Had a ton of fun trying to filter out water from the lake,
turns out the Sawyer filter is not quite there yet
* Attempted to find a spot on the east shore from the lake, but it was all
taken by boats, so traversed to the west shore instead and settled down
between some boulders and the sea
* Tent setup went surprisingly well
* Late but smooth fire making and steaks grilling
* Snugged up under the UQ by 1AM
* Saw a seal the next morning
* Mostly chilled in the hammock
* Had a blast 2001-ing a large herbivorous skull üíÄ
* Hiked back with a nice swim on the way
* Found a creepy crypt belonging to a "Sj√∂gren" and tried to figure out
who he was or if there were any leeches in there
* Rushed it a bit, thinking we won't make it in time for the pendel home, but managed to get
one from one station farther North instead

## 06.19 - Bouldery Midsommar around (Gamla) Grisslehamn

### Experiences

* Tighten up shoes before climbing on boulders
* Ice-cream sugar rush was awesome (and also the meth Sk√•neman song).
* The shoreline North of Stockholm is extremely beautiful.
* [Very tasty falafel](https://j.mp/37Ja9K0)
* Bring pot regardless of leaving gas stove home
* Try out larger variety of canned food
* Do not use towel as sitting pad
* Stick stove suitable for steaks if enough coals are formed - just use thicker fat wood sticks
* Some water fountains require extra bucket to be present to reactivate the pump - respect that
* Some people have way too much time on their hands for redecorating the front lawn
* Mesh bags + drum-liner made life waaaaay easier
* Do not pass hot cans to friends who aren't wearing gloves
* Bouldering jacked up on sugars is fun
* Mosquitoes can **(and will)** bite through socks

## 06.06 - S√∂rmlandsleden between H√§lleforsn√§s and Eskilstuna

### Photos

### Experiences

* Sleep stuff: optimize, sync with the Sun, test hang after hanging, maybe try
a mask for blocking out light
* Fruits + veggies infinitely better than ketchup/senap/fried onion retardation
* Devise method for checking horizontal level of ridge line
* *Buy more wool stuff + a damn towel*
* Weigh all components and re-think pack to make it even lighter
* Try out a single cocoon-like quilt for warm weather instead of pad + bag
* Splitting wood is fun
* Dry platform for kindling fire

## 05.30 - Tyresta

### Photos

### Experiences

* Focus on better hydration during walk segments (perhaps try to fill camelbak
instead of filter)
* Don't be leavin' that Morakniv on the forest floor
* Prusiks + carbines rock
* Don't put scorching hot titanium parts on top of textile sleeves
* No more ketchup + senap, go with spring onions instead
* Dry fat wood is really nice to get the fire going
* Still need a plate
* Have spare batteries
* Have drumliner trash bags

## 05.21 - Orn√∂

### Photos

{{ gallery("2020.05.21.orn√∂") }}

### Experiences

* Keep your dominant leg behind when hitting/splitting/fucking up logs with
two-handed swings
* It's possible to pack for 1 night in 20L, but definitely not enough room
for culinary spoiling
* Bring the 65-er ffs
* Rotate ferro rods to avoid permanent damage from the knife edge
* Build wooden base for storing fuel above ground to avoid moisture creeping in
* Get: hiking towel, <del>thermal pad</del>, <del>wool shirts</del>, ...,
large titanium saucepan (to be used as plate too)
* Wood stove is friggin' amazing if the weather / fuel situation permits it
* Ridge-line: move Prusiks on other side of Bowline
*before* tightening up with hitch
* Should clean up water filter at home after usage
* Do not use gloves when filling up water filter
* Humans are mostly stupid and uncooperative (sic)
* Need compass + offline maps
* Learn the [tripod](https://www.animatedknots.com/tripod-lashing-knot) + [square](https://www.animatedknots.com/square-lashing-knot) lashings
* Wind situation is much milder when camping inland
* Need to find a way to avoid/clean some of the grease from Ti cookware
(small metallic brush?)
* Use sunscreen

## 05.09 - Bj√∂rn√∂

### Photos

### Experiences

* Not cool to lose pack members
* It is possible to camp really close to the sea if shielded by trees
* Blood moon was awesome
* Some very nice music from Andrew
* Double check if you packed the pocket flask

## 05.02 - Paradiset

### Photos

{{ gallery("2020.05.02.paradiset") }}

### Experiences

* Monet-like sunset
* [Gomboy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8OGM88) is an absolute beast
* Starting fires does actually require a fair amount of sticks and pencils
* It's fairly easy to cook yummy chorizo + garlic + oil + jalapeno dinner
* Facing the A-frame of the tarp towards water is not necessarily bad, it
actually doesn't matter at all when camping on shore of inland lakes, and the
view is so much better
* Managed to lose a spork: from now on everything I pack should either be
intrinsically reflective or get a paracord lanyard
* Some very nice music from Markus

## 04.11 - Tyresta

### Photos

{{ gallery("2020.04.11.tyresta") }}

### Experiences

* First hike with the [65L Osprey](https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/camping-and-hiking/backpacks-backpacking/osprey-atmos-65-ag) - amazing suspension, awesome camelbak
* Didn't even bring a knife to sharpen sticks for hot dogs :-(
* Viking fire lay worked very well in windy conditions
* Random dude on the other side of the lake navigating through seemingly
impossible terrain while looking at his phone
* Pack of napkins accidentally thrown into the lake
