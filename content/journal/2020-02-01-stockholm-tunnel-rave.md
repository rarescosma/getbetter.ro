Probably the best party of my life (so far): 18 *hours* of positive vibes,
techno energy and real people.

Thank you Stockholm for finally letting me graduate into this beautiful crowd!

And thank you [Sara Gat](https://soundcloud.com/saragat), Justyna, Spaceflight, Peter Gun, Under Ed,
Raveman & SICKXS for the insanely electrifying and deeply afflicting tunes!

Don't even get me started on the tunnel [reverb effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation).

Rough, rough, **ROUGH!!!**

But most of all thank you Luis for watching out for your friend and managing
the logistics so well!

This memory is for life, truly a spiritual transformation.
